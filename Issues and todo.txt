## Todo ##
Add hard point to lantern top/bottom
Tweak magma creation

Empty bookshleves (and other shelf-type blocks)
Change how chair model is done to allow back to have collision
Add capacity to have interchangeable ids in shaped recipes.
Change cactus to stay on red sand

## Issues ##
Some stone type slabs and stairs have the wrong or missing names
Cherry leaves don't decay until a leaf is mined. Probably applies to acacia too.
Grass with snow is colored
Mobs still spawn on glass
Tree growth does not check against all log or leaf types
Fertilizer is not properly placing ferns
Iron doors and trapdoors do not check redstone state when placed
Benches and tables do not have the right selection hitbox
Occasionally walls will not update when they should show or not show a post. Updating any nearby block fixes this.
Hedge subblocks do not always show the right color on the item.
Walls connected to two panes on opposite sides still have posts.
Walls connected to panes which have a wall above them do not render full height connections.
Missing dye combo recipes using white dye
Item frame map z-fighting
Shift clicking into a workbench creates ghost items.
Flowers pop off in darkness but only after a block update. [Vanilla behavior but I intend to fix it]
New block sounds, except for mining, are silent in multiplayer for clients who do not have new sounds installed.
Slabs do not use custom sounds.
Entities can have weird collision with pergolas.

Issues rendering the right metadata on flower pots. [MCPatcher only]
Glass pane ctm is broken. [MCPatcher only]
