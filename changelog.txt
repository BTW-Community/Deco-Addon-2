Version 2.13
I lost most of the data on my PC between this version and the last. While the source code for deco was safe on github, I did lose the old changelog (new changelog is backed up on github now). I've tried to reconstruct it from memory but there is a high likelihood that some changes or fixes present in this version are not listed in the changelog.
THIS VERSION WILL REQUIRE A CLEAN INSTALL
Due to my grass changes, if you use mcpatcher this version and all future versions must be installed with mcpatcher and cannot be installed over it.

Thanks to Sockthing for the textures for acacia saplings, blood wood doors and trap doors, and spider eye blocks!

- Refactored the addon to use BTW Extended Addon API to increase compatibility with future addons. This is provided as a separate download.
- Refactored file prefix to "Deco" rather than "Addon". This, and the below texture name change, were relics from Yhetti's development and have both been changed for clarity given the opening up of BTW modding.
- Refactored texture names to make them more consistent, following BTW's naming scheme to use things such as decoBlockXXXX and removing ginger_ as the prefix. This means texture packs will need to update to use the new file names.
- Added localization support. Included with the addon in the lang folder is the file Deco_en_US.lang, which contains all english translations for the addon. Anyone who wishes to make and distribute translations is free to do so, and I will include it here if you link it.
- Added acacia trees and the accompanying wood type. Acacia saplings can be crafted with an oak sapling, fertilizer, and gray dye in a cauldron.
- Added autumn trees. These trees generate as oak trees with red, orange, or yellow leaves. Autumn saplings can be crafted with an oak sapling, fertilizer, and red, orange, or yellow dye in a cauldron.
- Added iron trapdoors, crafted with 4 iron ingots and 2 redstone latches, producing 2. They work just like iron doors and will only respond to redstone signals.
- Added spider eye blocks, created by packing 16 spider eyes together, and spider eye slabs.
- Added the ability for fertilizer to spawn ferns.
- Added the ability for the block dispenser to use fertilizer on grass to spawn flowers. The block dispenser will also not immediately suck up flowers placed using fertilizer (but can still suck up flowers in other circumstances). This, combined with the recipe change below, allows for automated production of flowers and dye.
- Added the lily of the valley as a new type of flower, which can be ground down into 2 white dye.
- Added broken paper lanterns, which look similar to normal paper lanterns but give off no light. They can be crafted by excluding the candle from the normal paper lantern recipe.
- Changed grass to not die while in darkness in order to facilitate its decorative use and to prevent ugly dirt under overhangs or dense trees. However, to maintain balance, animals may not eat from grass without sunlight, and the texture updates slightly to reflect this.
- Changed terracotta to break into 8 red sand piles when broken with an iron pick or lower. This and the below change were done for balance with my upcoming world gen addon.
- Changed stone variants (and polished versions) to drop their loose cobblestone variant when broken with an iron pick or lower in order to match sandstone.
- Changed (increased) the hardness and blast resistance of terracotta.
- Changed doors to stack to 16.
- Changed trapdoors above ladders to only be climbable if the trapdoor is attached to the same face as the ladder.
- Changed chair collision and selection box to better match the model. I intend to make further changes here, such as to make the back collidable, but that will require some further rewrites.
- Changed coarse dirt to be able to grow reeds, flowers, and other plants.
- Changed rendering on tables to have a wider leg if the block type uses walls instead of fences to match the thickness of the walls, and changed the legs to connect to each other when adjacent to match the rendering of walls.
- Changed the texture on polished stone, polished stone variants, polished infused stone, cut sandstone, and cut red sandstone columns to better reflect their model.
- Changed the name of several items and blocks slightly to be more consistent.
- Changed the collision box of pergolas to make them a full half block tall to allow stepping onto full blocks from them.
- Changed (decreased) the amount of tall grass which spawns from fertilizer.
- Changed (increased) the amount of flowers which spawn from fertilizer.
- Changed the fertilizer recipe to be made in a cauldron, and to use potash instead of dung. This, combined with the the block dispenser change above, allows for automation of flowers.
- Changed the textures of blood wood doors and trapdoors as they were previously recolors of vanilla's acacia textures.
- Refactored loose slab code to simplify the related code and assimilate it into the main slab code.
- Removed specific textures for subblocks (except columns). Subblocks will now simply use the texture of their base block. However, MCPatcher will still allow texturepacks to override these textures if texturepack authors wish to do so.
- Removed the item form of superheated netherrack and nether brick, meaning they can only exist in the world but not in inventories.
- Removed the ability to stick axes in hay or thatch.
- Fixed an issue where doors would drop 2 items if the top block was broken.
- Fixed an issue where white stone slabs only crafted 1.
- Fixed an issue where painted plank stairs only dropped a single moulding when sawed.
- Fixed an issue where dyeing carpets consumed 16 despite producing 12.
- Fixed an issue where loose nether brick slabs would turn into black stone slabs when applying mortar in a stoked cauldron.
- Fixed an issue where normal loose nether brick slabs were named loose red nether brick slabs.
- Fixed an issue where terracotta subblocks made wood sounds.
- Fixed an issue where most addon tables would not connect to walls below them.
- Fixed an issue where painted plank stairs were not available in the creative menu.
- Fixed an issue where placing a slab against a top slab would crash the game.
- Fixed an issue where soul sand used the stone sound for clients without new sounds installed.
- Fixed an issue where filled barrels would always drop wheat when broken with an improper tool.
- Fixed an issue where diamondium shears made sounds twice when crafted.
- Fixed an issue where dyeing wool with addon dyes required a stoked cauldron instead of a regular cauldron.
- Fixed an issue where black roses would not properly spawn from fertilizer.
- Fixed an issue where the renaming gui erroneously had 2 slots even though only 1 was functional.
- Fixed an issue where renaming items on the workbench would also name items in the top left inventory slot.
- Fixed an issue where renaming an item still required the player to have a certian number of experience levels, even though they were not consumed.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to place a sign would always play a sound, even if  placement was not successful.
- Fixed a vanilla issue where right clicking an iron door still made the animation like something had happened.
- Fixed an issue (hopefully) where servers would incorrectly display an error message that the addon was not installed properly if the client was on a high latency connection. Let me know if this still happens as this simply involved increasing the amount of time the server would wait for the client to acknowledge. This functionality was also moved to the Extended Addon API to allow other addons using the API to access this code.
