## Version 4.0.0 ##
Deco as of 4.0.0 is now a fabric mod, without any base class edits, and as such can simply be placed in the mods folder to install.

Some textures in this release have been used or modified from the following sources according to their license:
- Blockus
- Terra Incognita
- Quark
- Wild Nature
- Biome Makeover
- Compat Makeover

- Rewrote the addon from scratch as a fabric mod. Note that data is stored in the same way, and thus it is save-compatible (it is still a good idea to back up your worlds before updating).
- Added a config option, disabled by default, to allow diamond pickaxes to always pick up stone intact instead of requiring isolation.
- Added glazed terracotta pillars, crafted with two glazed terracotta in a vertical line.
- Changed unfired terracotta to be crafted with full blocks instead of 8 piles for convenience.
- Added tall grass and large ferns, which can be spawned from using fertilizer on grass blocks, or by using it on ferns and grass to grow them.
    - Sock's Crops has been accounted for when adding these - it uses the same id and will not be added by deco if SC is present.
- Added tall flowers, which can also be obtained through using fertilizer.
- Changed peonies, lilacs, and rose bushes to be tall flowers. Old versions may be converted into the new tall versions in a crafting grid.
- Changed the textures and names of some flowers.
- Added mud, created by leaving loose dirt underwater.
- Added packed mud, created by piston packing two mud blocks.
- Added mud brick, created with 4 packed mud in a crafting grid, along with associated sub blocks.
- Added new wood types: mahogany, mangrove, hazel, fir
    - For the purposes of smelting and tanning:
        - Mahogany and mangrove are equivalent to jungle
        - Hazel is equivalent to oak
        - Fir is equivalent to birch
    - Jungle spiders can spawn on mangrove and mahogany leaves
- Changed autumn saplings to produce different wood types depending on color.
- Changed sapling recipes:
    - All sapling recipes can use either dung or fertilizer, and are performed in a cauldron.
    - Cherry saplings require an oak sapling, pink dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Acacia saplings require a birch sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Mahogany saplings require a jungle sapling, red dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Mangrove saplings require a jungle sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Hazel saplings require an oak sapling, brown dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Fir saplings require a spruce sapling, white dye (or bonemeal), and a fertilizer.
    - Red autumn saplings require a cherry sapling, red dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Orange autumn saplings require an oak sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Yellow autumn saplings require a birch sapling, yellow dye, and a fertilizer.
- Added the ability for cocoa beans to grow on mangrove and mahogany logs.
- Added calcite - loose calcite cobblestone can be crated by combining loose diorite cobblestone with bonemeal in a crucible
- Added tuff - loose tuff cobblestone can be crated by combining loose cobblestone with pumice in a crucible
- Changed deco stone variants to behave consistently with BTW stone.
    - Granite, andesite, diorite, and calcite are all considered first strata.
    - Slate is considered third strata.
- Changed how lanterns render, and added item equivalents. The old blocks may be converted into items in a crafting grid.
- Changed lanterns to break when underwater.
- Changed wrought iron bars and paper walls to output more when crafting.
- Changed red sand (blocks and piles) to be a subtype of regular sand. Old red sand may be converted into new red sand in a crafting grid.
- Changed red sand to be crafted with 8 sand and 1 red dye to make 8.
- Changed the recipe for coarse dirt to produce 2.
- Added the ability to filter coarse dirt through a wicker filter in a hopper to separate it into dirt and gravel.
- Changed the recipe for podzol to be 8 coarse dirt and a spruce or fir leaf block to make 8.
- Changed the recipe for empty bottle racks to use an 'I' shape instead of an 'X' (high efficiency recipe uses siding on top and bottom and moulding everywhere else).
- Changed the names of flower textures to be more descriptive.
- Changed magma to be made by heating netherrack in a kiln, and removed superheated netherrack.
- Changed nether brick to turn into brick in a kiln, and removed superheated nether brick.
- Changed hay bales and thatch to be made of 8 items instead of 9, and added the ability to decraft stairs into items.
- Removed the ability to rename items using the workbench. This functionality will be restored in a future release.
- Removed the ability to play custom sounds. This will return once BTW updates to 1.6 (with its new resource system), but for now the code was too messy to carry over through the rewrite.
- Removed wood bleach and wood stain.
- Fixed an issue where addon leaves would not properly decay until updated.
- Fixed an issue where addon trees would generate two stumps when smashing a fertilized planter.
- Fixed an issue where the top and bottom textures of pergolas would not properly rotate with the model.
- Fixed an issue where saplings could not grow on coarse dirt or podzol.
- Fixed an issue where climbing a ladder by holding space would climb too fast.
