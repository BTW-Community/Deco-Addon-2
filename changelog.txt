Version 2.13
I lost most of the data on my PC between this version and the last. While the source code for deco was safe on github, I did lose the old changelog. I've tried to reconstruct it from memory but there is a high liklihood that some changes or fixes present in this version are not listed in the changelog.
[list]
[*]Refactored the addon to use Dawn's Library. This is provided as a separate download.
[*]Refactored file prefix to "Deco" rather than "Addon" for clarity.
[*]Refactored texture names to make them more consistent. This will mean texture packs will need to update to the new file names.
[*]Added iron trapdoors, crafted with 4 iron ingots and 2 redstone latches, producing 2.
[*]Changed grass to not die while in darkness in order to facilitate its decorative use and to prevent ugly dirt under overhangs or dense trees. However, to maintain balance, animals may not eat from grass without sunlight, and the texture updates to reflect this.
[*]Changed terracotta to break into 8 sand piles when broken with an iron pick or lower.
[*]Changed stone variants to drop their loose cobblestone variant when broken with an iron pick or lower.
[*]Changed (increased) the hardness and blast resistance of terracotta.
[*]Changed doors to stack to 16.
[*]Changed trapdoors above ladders to only be climbable if the trapdoor is attached to the same face as the ladder.
[*]Changed chair collision and selection box to better match the model.
[*]Changed rendering on tables to have a wider leg if the block type uses walls to match the thickness of the walls.
[*]Changed the texture on polished stone, polished stone variant, polished infused stone, cut sandstone, and cut red sandstone columns.
[*]Removed specific textures for subblocks (except columns). Subblocks will now simply use the texture of their base block. However, MCPatcher will still allow texturepacks to override these textures if texturepack authors wish to do so.
[*]Fixed an issue where doors would drop 2 items if the top block was broken.
[*]Fixed an issue where white stone slabs only made 1.
[*]Fixed an issue where painted plank stairs only dropped a single moulding when sawed.
[*]Fixed an issue where dyeing carpets consumed 16 despite producing 12.
[*]Fixed an issue where loose nether brick slabs would turn into black stone slabs when applying mortar in a stoked cauldron.
[*]Fixed an issue where normal loose nether brick slabs were named loose red nether brick slabs.
[*]Fixed an issue where terracotta subblocks made wood sounds.
[*]Fixed (hopefully) an issue where servers would incorrectly display an error message that the addon was not installed properly if the client was on a high latency connection. Let me know if this still happens as this simply involved increasing the amount of time the server would wait for the client to acknowledge from 1 second to 2.5.
