## Version 4.0.0 ##
- Rewrote the addon from scratch as a fabric mod. Note that data is stored in the same way, and thus it is save-compatible (it is still a good idea to back up your worlds before updating).
- Added new wood types: mahogany, mangrove, hazel
- Changed sapling recipes:
    - All sapling recipes can use either dung or fertilizer
    - Cherry saplings now require an oak sapling, pink dye, and a fertilizer
    - Acacia saplings now require a birch sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer
    - Mahogany saplings require a jungle sapling, red dye, and a fertilizer
    - Mangrove saplings require a jungle sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer
    - Hazel saplings require an oak sapling, brown dye, and a fertilizer
- Changed red sand (blocks and piles) to be a subtype of regular sand. Old red sand may be converted into new red sand in a crafting grid.
- Changed red sand to be crafted with 8 sand and 1 red dye.
- Changed the recipe for coarse dirt to produce 2.
- Changed the recipe for podzol to be 8 coarse dirt and a spruce leaf block to make 8.
- Removed the ability to play custom sounds. This will return in a future release, but for now the code was too messy to carry over through the rewrite.
- Removed wood bleach and wood stain.
- Changed the recipe for empty bottle racks to use an 'I' shape instead of an 'X' (high efficiency recipe uses siding on top and bottom and moulding everywhere else).
- Changed the names of flower textures to be more descriptive.
- Fixed an issue where addon leaves would not properly decay until updated.
- Fixed an issue where addon trees would generate two stumps when smashing a planter.
- Fixed an issue where the top and bottom textures of pergolas would not properly rotate with the model.
- Fixed an issue where saplings could not grow on coarse dirt.
