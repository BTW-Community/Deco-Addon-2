## Version 4.0.0 ##
Deco as of 4.0.0 is now a fabric mod, without any base class edits, and as such can simply be placed in the mods folder to isntall.

Some textures in this release have been used or modified from the following sources according to their license:
- Blockus
- Terra Incognita
- Quark

- Rewrote the addon from scratch as a fabric mod. Note that data is stored in the same way, and thus it is save-compatible (it is still a good idea to back up your worlds before updating).
- Added glazed terracotta pillars, crafted with two glazed terracotta in a vertical line.
- Changed unfired terracotta to be crafted with full blocks instead of 8 piles for convenience.
- Added new wood types: mahogany, mangrove, hazel
- Changed sapling recipes:
    - All sapling recipes can use either dung or fertilizer
    - Cherry saplings now require an oak sapling, pink dye, and a fertilizer
    - Acacia saplings now require a birch sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer
    - Mahogany saplings require a jungle sapling, red dye, and a fertilizer
    - Mangrove saplings require a jungle sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer
    - Hazel saplings require an oak sapling, brown dye, and a fertilizer
- Changed red sand (blocks and piles) to be a subtype of regular sand. Old red sand may be converted into new red sand in a crafting grid.
- Changed red sand to be crafted with 8 sand and 1 red dye.
- Changed the recipe for coarse dirt to produce 2.
- Changed the recipe for podzol to be 8 coarse dirt and a spruce leaf block to make 8.
- Removed the ability to play custom sounds. This will return in a future release, but for now the code was too messy to carry over through the rewrite.
- Removed wood bleach and wood stain.
- Changed the recipe for empty bottle racks to use an 'I' shape instead of an 'X' (high efficiency recipe uses siding on top and bottom and moulding everywhere else).
- Changed the names of flower textures to be more descriptive.
- Fixed an issue where addon leaves would not properly decay until updated.
- Fixed an issue where addon trees would generate two stumps when smashing a planter.
- Fixed an issue where the top and bottom textures of pergolas would not properly rotate with the model.
- Fixed an issue where saplings could not grow on coarse dirt.
