## Version 4.0.0 ##
Deco as of 4.0.0 is now a fabric mod, without any base class edits, and as such can simply be placed in the mods folder to install.

Some textures in this release have been used or modified from the following sources according to their license:
- Blockus
- Terra Incognita
- Quark

- Rewrote the addon from scratch as a fabric mod. Note that data is stored in the same way, and thus it is save-compatible (it is still a good idea to back up your worlds before updating).
- Added a config option, disabled by default, to allow diamond pickaxes to always pick up stone intact instead of requiring isolation.
- Added glazed terracotta pillars, crafted with two glazed terracotta in a vertical line.
- Changed unfired terracotta to be crafted with full blocks instead of 8 piles for convenience.
- Added new wood types: mahogany, mangrove, hazel
    - For the purposes of smelting and tanning:
        - Mahogany and mangrove are equivalent to jungle
        - Hazel is equivalent to oak
- Changed sapling recipes:
    - All sapling recipes can use either dung or fertilizer, and are performed in a cauldron.
    - Cherry saplings now require an oak sapling, pink dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Acacia saplings now require a birch sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Mahogany saplings require a jungle sapling, red dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Mangrove saplings require a jungle sapling, orange dye, and a fertilizer.
    - Hazel saplings require an oak sapling, brown dye, and a fertilizer.
- Changed deco stone variants to behave consistently with BTW stone.
    - Granite, andesite, and diorite are all considered first strata.
    - Slate is considered third strata.
- Changed red sand (blocks and piles) to be a subtype of regular sand. Old red sand may be converted into new red sand in a crafting grid.
- Changed red sand to be crafted with 8 sand and 1 red dye to make 8.
- Changed the recipe for coarse dirt to produce 2.
- Changed the recipe for podzol to be 8 coarse dirt and a spruce leaf block to make 8.
- Changed the recipe for empty bottle racks to use an 'I' shape instead of an 'X' (high efficiency recipe uses siding on top and bottom and moulding everywhere else).
- Changed the names of flower textures to be more descriptive.
- Changed magma to be made by heating netherrack in a kiln, and removed superheated netherrack.
- Removed the ability to play custom sounds. This will return in a future release, but for now the code was too messy to carry over through the rewrite.
- Removed wood bleach and wood stain.
- Fixed an issue where addon leaves would not properly decay until updated.
- Fixed an issue where addon trees would generate two stumps when smashing a fertilized planter.
- Fixed an issue where the top and bottom textures of pergolas would not properly rotate with the model.
- Fixed an issue where saplings could not grow on coarse dirt or podzol.
