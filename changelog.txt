- Blockus
- Terra Incognita
- Quark
- Wild Nature
- Biome Makeover
- Compat Makeover

- Rewrote the addon from scratch as a fabric mod. Note that data is stored in the same way, and thus it is save-compatible (it is still a good idea to back up your worlds before updating).

- Added glazed terracotta pillars, crafted with two glazed terracotta in a vertical line.
